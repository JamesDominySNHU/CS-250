•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

When creating a program, it's important to understand what users need. To do this, you can listen to their requirements and create user stories that outline their needs in a simple way. These stories help you break down tasks for building the program. After implementing the program, test it with users and use their feedback to improve it until it meets their needs effectively.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When starting to develop programs, it's important to have a systematic approach. Begin by understanding what the program needs to do – talk to users, gather requirements, and create a clear plan. Break the project into smaller tasks, and then start building one step at a time. Regularly test your progress to catch any issues early. As for Agile processes, incorporating practices like Scrum or Kanban can be helpful. These methods promote flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. They encourage you to work in small cycles, receive feedback often, and adjust your plan as needed. This can lead to better results and a smoother development process overall.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a strong team member in software development involves effective communication, collaboration, and technical skills. You should actively listen to your teammates and users to understand requirements, share your ideas, and ask questions when needed. Collaborate by contributing your expertise, respecting others' opinions, and working well together. Strong programming skills are crucial, but equally important are adaptability and a willingness to learn. Be open to feedback and take initiative, showing a proactive attitude in problem-solving. Lastly, maintain a positive and respectful attitude towards your team, which helps create a productive and supportive working environment.
